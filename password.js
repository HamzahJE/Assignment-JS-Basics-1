// Create a new file called password.js. Write a program that does the following:

// Create a variable called password and set itâ€™s value to a string of your choice.

let password="123kejrkjer3"

// Write a conditional statement that checks if the password meets the following constraints:

// At least 10 characters long

// Contains at least one letter and one number
let passwordArr= password.split("")
console.log(passwordArr)
// If the password meets the constraint, console log a success message.

// If the password fails the constraint, console log a failure message.


// Test out your conditional by changing the value of your password variable and running your file!
