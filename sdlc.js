const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const anylasisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, clearly define and layout the requirments of the project and work everything out with the customer " 

const design="This is the third step, in this step you take everything in from the requirments and custumer input and using all of these you come up with the design for the product "

const implementation= "This is the fourth step, here you configue the product for certain conditons of use as well as you teach users and customers about how to use the product "

const testingAndIntegration ="This is the fifth step, in this step you test out the product and make sure that it meets the requirments and objectives previously defined and you work on defining, reporting and fixing defects. As well as you look at how all parts of the product gets integrated with the each other and work together "

const maintain="This is the sixth and last step, after you release and get the product to the public, you must address any issue or problems that might come up in the future. Find bugs and fix them as well as to keep the product up to standard "
